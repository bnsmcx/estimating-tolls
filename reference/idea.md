# Random notes about the origination of the idea

```
I think the first objective is coming up with a more accurate pricing tool on the front side. That way companies can handle the new business coming in. That stops a pretty big leak. And we can interrupt the flow of "garbage in" in the system. There is so much new business that happens, it would be effective.

Functionality Ideas

- Generate "mapquest" route info on best/worstcase scenarios
- 6 months previous traffic history to provide backup about why a route is most likely taken - in case a customer wants historical information to justify what we are charging
- Weekday vs weekend traffic fluctuations - some lanes we know when they will be running
- Terminals within a certain radius of the shipper, so can compare what the most favorable terminal to run the lane is based on tolls incurred
- Options to include just the origin/destination or all the route points of the lane
- Output option to reflect tolls by state - similar to how PC Miler displays
- Bids come in excel sheets typically, have functionality to upload multiple lanes and have output display so it doesn't have to typed manually

A different idea but along the same lines as the tolls.

If there were a way to input the tolling authority with the exit information to display what route was taken based on the date and time stamp of the tolls.
